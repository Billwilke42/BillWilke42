My name is Bill Wilke (He/Him) and I am a current Front-end student at the Turing School of Software & Design (Expected Graduation Date: 9/25/2020). I love creating dynamic web applications that are beautiful as well as being chock full of features. I am proficient in JavaScript, Redux, Express, CSS/SASS, HTML, Git, Node, Redux Thunks, and Jest, but I am trying to grow that list every day. I have a passion for team-building, learning, creative problem solving, and sharing my knowledge with others. If you have any tips for my creations or any job opportunities, please send me a message on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-wilke-6b863796) or via email at billwilke2@gmail.com!
